Some Emails Tell me your system did X, Y or Z this week.

And for ages, or indefintiely, I will wonder is that good? what did I do before? what is my lowest? My Highest value for the system? Nonetheless, the emails just sit in the archives waiting for someone to coallesce them into a sensible report. Alas, I will never do that - but this plugin will.
